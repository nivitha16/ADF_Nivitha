1. Read a file and store the unique words in a list sorted based on length of word in a new file along with each word length appended to it?
Initialize a empty set and read a file named "nivi.txt" and stored in a string. Iterate each line in file to split each word based on space and store it in string. Iterate string to find length of each word and appended word and length into set. Sort set based on length of each word and convert to list. Create a new file and write list items into new file.

2.Read a CSV (CSV with n number of columns) and store it in DICT of list?
First create a CSV file in your local computer. In Python file, Import csv and read a csv file and store it in string. Initialize a dictionary named "Details". Iterate each row in csv file and consider 0th value as key and store remaining values to tha key in dictionary.

3. Print all Prime Numbers in an Interval of 5 seconds?
First import time. Iterate "i" npto infinity in while loop to find prime number or not using flag. If it is a prime number display it and put "time.sleep(5)" to print numbers in a interval of 5 seconds. If it is not prime number number, proceed with further iteration.

4. Program to Find HCF or GCD?
Get two numbers as input and convert to absolute value for finding gcd for both positive and negative numbers. Find minimum number of two input and iterate for loop from 2 to that minimum number. Check if (a%2==0 and b%2==0) in every iteration. If both condition is satisfied, then that iterate "i" value is the GCD of that 2 numbers.

5.Convert Decimal to Binary: Octal and Hexadecimal?
Get a number as input and initialize a string. Iterate while loop till "n!=0". find remainder by dividing number by 2 and find floor division value of number by 2. Append remainder to string for every iteration. Display the binary representation.
Get a number as input and initialize a string. Iterate while loop till "n!=0". find remainder by dividing number by 8 and find floor division value of number by 8. Append remainder to string for every iteration. Display the octal representation.
Get a number as input and initialize a string and list. Iterate while loop till "n!=0". find remainder by dividing number by 16 and find floor division value of number by 16. Append remainder to list for every iteration. Display the hexadecimal representation.

6. Find ASCII Value of Character?
Get a character as input. Use inbuilt function named "ord()" to get ascii value of a character. Display "ord(ch)" which prints ascii value of a character.

7. Get an application (name , age , gender, salary, state, city)
Get input for name,age,gender,salary,state,city with correct datatype from the user. Display all the inputs to user.
